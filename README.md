I need a paragraph overview of your model

## Getting Started with MOSART-Heat
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
I need a list of libraries that you need to compile/run your code and where to find them publicly if they are not included in your code.

### Compiling MOSART-Heat
I need a step-by-step "how-to" guide to compile your code.  Assume that the user has never compiled code before in their lives.

### Running MOSART-Heat
I need a step-by-step "how-to" guide to run your code/executable.
